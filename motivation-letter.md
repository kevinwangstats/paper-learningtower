Dear Professor Hyndman,
\bigskip

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "`learningtower`: An R Package for Exploring Standardized Test Scores Across the Globe, for consideration in the R Journal."

This paper introduces `learningtower`, a newly developed R package that offers easy access to a curated subset of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data, collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 2000 to 2022. Designed for ease of use, the package enables efficient data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. Additionally, we present several example analyses, including an examination of gender disparities in student performance, the impact of socioeconomic factors on academic achievement, and a focused study on Australiaâ€™s PISA scores.

We believe this article will be of significant interest to R Journal readers, as it provides practical tools and methodologies applicable to a wide range of research fields. PISA is a well-recognized, publicly available dataset with the potential to yield valuable insights for educational policy, social research, and statistical modeling. By enhancing accessibility and usability, learningtower empowers researchers to derive meaningful conclusions that can inform data-driven decision-making in education and beyond.
